# When Was the Golden Era of Video Games?

## Datacamp Project Description:
According to Mordor Intelligence, video games are big business: the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than $300 billion by 2027. With so much money at stake, the major game publishers are hugely incentivized to create the next big hit. But are games getting better, or has the golden age of video games already passed?

In this project, you'll analyze video game critic and user scores, in addition to sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. You'll search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and you'll explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

## Project Instructions: 
1) Find the ten best-selling games.
2) Find the ten years with the highest average critic score.
3) Find the years where critics and users broadly agreed that games released were highly rated. Specifically, return the years where the average critic score was over 9 OR the average user score was over 9.
